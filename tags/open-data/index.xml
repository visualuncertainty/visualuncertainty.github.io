      <description>The R blogosphere is an incredible place right now. From R-Bloggers to R Weekly, there are dozens of posts produced daily on new methods and real world applications of R. When writing any blog my first question is what can this post add that hasn’t already been said somewhere on the internet already? Blogs are often focused on new and exciting methodologies, visualisations or applications, answering interesting questions, yet very few focus on what we Data Scientists spend most of our time doing - data wrangling and cleaning.</description>

      <title>Mining Mumsnet Opinions with R and RVest - Part 1</title>

      <description>Mumsnet is an incredible source of information and opinions. Providing anonymised and moderated message boards, it is an interesting segment of a large demographic of public opinion. Obviously it struggles from the inherent biases of all social media platforms, but it attracts a different crowd and a less polarising tone than unanonymised platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, helped by careful moderation from MNHQ. Data Scientists commonly mine Facebook and Twitter to measure public opinion, and APIs are available for doing this, but I think Mumsnet conversations can add to the depth of online opinion mining.</description>

      <title>The local elections in Barnet: What really happened?</title>

      <description>The Barnet council result has been the most startling in the recent local elections. Consistently predicted in pre-election polls as a Labour gain, Labour’s top target delivered an increased majority for the Conservatives. Many local people from all parties who were on the campaign trail have been quick to connect the Barnet result with Labour’s anti-semitism problems including Labour councillors and Barnet’s Labour leader. A blog by Dr Daniel Allington provides evidence for the link by showing a positive correlation between the increase in Conservative vote share in 2018 and the proportion of a ward that is Jewish and a similar decrease in the Labour vote, inferring that anti-semitism in Labour is likely to have driven the result in these key wards.</description>

      <description>Most electoral analysis is conducted by academics with University resources and collaborators. Not working in an academic institution and having spent some time researching what actually happened in the 2017 election, I have gathered some useful open data source and insights for election data that I thought would be helpful to share. In the following series of blog posts, I will describe where to find the data and why each bit of data is useful.</description>
